<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://acgnj.org/">ACGNJ</a> Java Users Group was formed in February 2001 by <a href="https://redlich.net/">Michael Redlich</a>. In October 2020, the Java group become independent of ACGNJ and rebranded itself the <a href="http://javasig.org">Garden State Java Users Group (GSJUG)</a>. GSJUG conducts monthly meetings for education related to the Java programming language. The group welcomes all skill levels and there is no charge to attend meetings. The group has hosted a number of well-known Java luminaries and has encouraged attendees to present on a topic for which he/she is passionate. Leadership of the group is composed of Michael Redlich, Barry Burd, and Chandra Guntur.</p>
<h3>How Our JUG Leaders Participate in Education</h3>
<h4>InfoQ Articles</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> (a part of <a href="https://c4media.com">C4Media</a>) is one of the best resources for students and developers, new and experienced, who wish to learn and adopt new technologies. InfoQ provides content created by eminent software engineering luminaries who are subject matter experts. Such content is curated by InfoQ community editors. InfoQ seeks out such engineers and practitioners, provides them with training and support to help them express their expertise. Feedback for the content states it being very relevant and helpful in triggering innovation and implementation of technologies by the target readers at their respective places of work. Michael Redlich is one of the well-known editors at InfoQ, having been in the role since May 2016.</p>
<h4>Authoring Books and Articles</h4>
<p>One of the primary means of learning for students and new developers is to use books on software. As an author of several popular books on Java, Android, Eclipse, Ruby, and XML, Barry Burd has helped several developers learn and also overcome difficulties that they face. Barry has also authored several articles on IoT, Virtual Reality, Android, and Java. In addition, Michael Redlich as editor and contributor at InfoQ, and Chandra Guntur on his personal blog, have authored several technical articles.</p>
<h4>Hosting meetup events at Drew University</h4>
<p>After 17 years at the Scotch Plains Rescue Squad in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, the group moved its monthly meetings to Drew University in Madison, New Jersey in February 2018. Members of the Drew community are regularly invited to attend the group’s meetings. Special meeting announcements go out to students in the university’s Computer Science courses, and students are encouraged to ask questions about material that hasn’t been covered in their courses. In this way, students network with computer professionals and get exposure to topics that can’t be covered in the time allotted for their regular classes.</p>

<h4>Java Code Katas</h4>
<p>One of the best tools in learning is hands-on exercises. Several code katas on Eclipse Collections, Obevo, and Java Fundamentals have been shared at the meetups. These code katas actively encourage students and developers to learn and practice development.</p>
